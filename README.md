# TURBO LAMBDA GIT FLOW

This flow creates a real-world workflow that also enables PMs to manage code reviews easily.

## PMs:

1. Create a GitHub Organization
2. Invite Members (i.e. Students) to join the Organization
3. Set Member Permissions to "Write"
4. Fork the LambdaSchool Project(s)/Challenges into the Organization

## Students:

1. Clone the project/challenge from the Organization repository
2. Create personal branch (firstname-lastname)
3. Push (their branch) changes back to Organization repository
4. Create a Pull Request to merge their branch to Master

## During the Day — PMs:

1. Can see all Pull Requests, Branches, and Commits in one place
2. Can easily see commit histories for each branch in one place
3. Can clone the repo at any time to their machine and pull all student branches at the same time for review (in one file).

## At th End of the Day — PMs:

1. Add a [REVIEW.md](http://review.md) file to each branch with comments for each student.
2. Add a Solution Branch to the repo
3. Push the file back to the Organization
4. Inform students that reviews are done for that repo and that they should review the comments and fork their own copies from the Organization repository.

## Students:

1. Fork their own copy of the repo from the Organization to their personal account.
2. Merge, delete, whatever they want to do with the project.
